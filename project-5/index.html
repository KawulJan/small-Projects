        <p class="text">The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the
            drawer with his fingertips and said softly:
            “Sit down.”
            “Good morning,” said the Mayor.
            “Morning,” said the dentist.
            While the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the
            headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office:
            an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he
            felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.
            Aurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor’s jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers.
            “It has to be without anesthesia,” he said.
            “Why?”
            “Because you have an abscess.” </p>

        <p class="text">The Mayor looked him in the eye. “All right,” he said, and tried to smile.
The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of
cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the
tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this
without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn’t take his eyes off him.
It was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the
tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced
his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn’t
make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather
with a bitter tenderness, he said:
“Now you’ll pay for our twenty dead men.”
The Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with
tears. But he didn’t breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it
through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.
Bent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and
reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a
clean cloth.</p>

    <p class="text">“Dry your tears,” he said.
        The Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands,
       he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider’s eggs and
        dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. “Go to bed,” he said,
        “and gargle with salt water.” The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without
        buttoning up his tunic. .</p>


    <p class="text">“Send the bill,” he said.
“To you or the town?”
The Mayor didn’t look at him. He closed the door and said through the
screen:
“It’s the same damn thing.” .</p>
            <p class="text">From Wikipedia: Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez (born
                March 6, 1927[1]) is a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter
                and journalist. García Márquez, familiarly known as "Gabo" in his native
                country, is one of Latin America’s most famous writers. He is considered
                one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, and in 1982 was
                awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. In his early years he was strongly
                influenced by his grandfather who raised him. As he grew, he pursued a
                highly self-directed education that resulted in his quitting law school in
                order to begin a career in journalism. Early in this career he demonstrated he had no inhibitions to be critical of politics within Colombia
                and beyond. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha and they have since
                had two sons together.</p>

            <p class="text">He started out as a journalist, and has written many acclaimed nonfiction works, and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as
One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Love in the Time of Cholera
(1985). He has achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as
magical realism in which he uses certain magical elements and events in
order to explain real experiences. Some of his works take place in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of
solitude.
